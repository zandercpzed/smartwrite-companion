# SmartWrite Companion v0.7.0: Now with Local LLM & Longform Integration! 🚀

Hello fellow writers!

I'm excited to announce a massive update to **SmartWrite Companion**, the all-in-one writing assistant that lives directly inside Obsidian.

If you're a fiction writer, blogger, or academic who wants AI assistance _without_ sending your drafts to the cloud, this update is for you.

## 🌟 What's New in v0.7.0?

### 1. 100% Local AI with Ollama 🔒

We've ditched the cloud. SmartWrite now integrates directly with **Ollama**, allowing you to run powerful models like **Qwen 2.5** entirely on your machine.

- **Privacy First**: Your manuscript never leaves your computer.
- **Free**: No API costs. No subscriptions.
- **Smart Personas**: Ask the "Critical Editor" for ruthless feedback or the "Encouraging Coach" for motivation.

### 2. Longform Plugin Integration 📚

This is the game-changer for novelists.

- **Project-Wide Analysis**: SmartWrite now detects your **Longform** projects automatically.
- **Stitched Context**: It reads your scene order (from the Longform index) and stitches them together into a single context for the AI.
- **Result**: You can ask the AI to analyze your _entire_ book for plot holes, pacing, or character consistency, not just one file at a time.

### 3. Advanced Readability & Stats 📊

- **Real-time Analysis**: Passive voice, adverbs, and complex sentence detection as you type.
- **Visual Gauge**: "Flesch-Kincaid" and "Gunning Fog" scores visualized instantly.
- **Session Tracking**: Set daily word count goals and track your writing speed.
